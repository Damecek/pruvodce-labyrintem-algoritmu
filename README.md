## Pruvodce labyrintem algoritmu
Repository for storing solved examples from the book _Pruvodce labyrintem algoritmu_

https://pruvodce.ucw.cz/

## How to contribute
Clone the repository and create a new branch for your solution. When you are done, create a pull request.

Currently the repository is in JS, but I am open to other languages as well. In case of new language we would have to change the folder structure to not mix the languages.
